# 🎸 Band Name Generator (Day 1)

This is the first project from the **100 Days of Code: The Python Pro Bootcamp**. It focuses on the absolute basics of Python to create a simple interactive command-line application.

## 📝 Project Description

The **Band Name Generator** is a fun script that takes user input to generate a creative band name. It combines the name of the city you grew up in with the name of a pet to suggest a unique name for your future music group.

### Key Learnings:

* **`print()`**: Outputting data to the console.
* **`input()`**: Capturing user strings from the terminal.
* **Variables**: Storing and retrieving data.
* **String Concatenation**: Joining strings together using the `+` operator.
* **New Lines**: Using `\n` to manage text formatting.
